# php_json_cq_user_group_report

My boss needed a report of all users in CQ.  This was a quick and dirty solution I spun up to get him the report quickly in CSV.

We have tons of users so I leveraged PHP for the JSON to CSV conversion.

Never did finish it as I started to spin up a GUI for him to run in any environment for all of our apps.
